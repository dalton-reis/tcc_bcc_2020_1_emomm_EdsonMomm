    <P>
    <HR width="100%">

    <P>Numerous 3D rendering software is now available to easily play the power 
    of computers. It allows more and more people, artists or engineers, to 
    produce photo-realistic images. 
    <P>Each time one needs to VIEW something unreachable with a camera, whether 
    it is because it does not exist or is out of scale for human eyes, one can 
    use a computer. 
    <P>However, how realistic can those images be? Anyone looking at the 
    computer screen can perfectly SEE that he is looking at an image, not 
    directly at a real scene, or model. 
    <P>This difference comes from the fact that in our three dimensional real 
    world our two eyes give us two different images. This is because they are in 
    two different positions in space, separated by an horizontal 2.5 inches 
    offset (~ 6.5 cm). The brain accepts the small horizontal disparity between 
    those two images, and in return gives a single image with accurate depth 
    perception. This ability is known as stereoscopy. 
    <P>Due to stereoscopy, you can perfectly notice the difference between a 
    model car in a box and the image of it on the top of the box despite both 
    having the same dimensions. Looking to the model, you see in stereo as each 
    eye has its own image of the car model. But when looking at the image on the 
    top, you see a flat image as both eyes are focused on the same image. 
    <P>Now, as we know the difference between "flat viewing" and "stereo 
    viewing", let's see how to use the first to create the second. <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name="Stereo 3D on"></A><B>1.) Stereo 3D on computers</B> 
    <P>Creating a stereo image means first creating two flat images, i.e., a 
    stereo pair: one image for the left eye and one for the right eye. This is 
    easy to achieve: you render one image with the observer in the left eye 
    position, apply an horizontal offset to the observer position and then 
    render the right eye image. The offset is called the BASE in the stereoscopy 
    vocabulary and is assumed to be the same as the inter-ocular distance (About 
    6.5 cm). 
    <P>The base has to be increased or decreased relatively to the scale of the 
    scene to have a significant stereo effect. Obviously, you cannot use the 
    inter-ocular distance to view in stereo a chemical molecule or a galaxy. A 
    typical average value for the base is 1/30 of the distance from the observer 
    to the nearest object of a scene. 
    <P>Why 1/30? If you stand in front of a window, which opens to a landscape 
    to the horizon, you will notice that you cannot see clearly both the horizon 
    AND the window itself if you stand within two meters away from the window. 
    <P>When you are two or more meters away from the window, you can view all 
    the scene comfortably from the nearest point (The window) to the infinity 
    (The horizon). This value of two meters depends on the person but is a 
    statistical value. The fact is that 6.5 cm (Inter-ocular distance) is about 
    1/30 of two meters. 
    <P>So, if you take for the base the 1/30 of the distance from the observer 
    to the nearest object of the scene, you're sure that you will see the full 
    stereo image comfortably from the first point until the last. You will also 
    be able to see it with enough stereo sensation. When the base is larger than 
    the average inter-ocular distance, the resulting stereo is called 
    hyper-stereo. It gives you the sensation of looking at reduced models, as if 
    you were a giant. On the other hand, when the base is smaller than the 
    average inter-ocular distance, the resulting stereo is called hypo-stereo. 
    It gives you the sensation of looking at enlarged models, as if you were a 
    Lilliputian. 
    <P>An error that needs to be avoided is making a stereo pair with converging 
    viewing axes. It appears natural to use convergence since eyes converge 
    while they are looking at something, although it is not the right way. When 
    your eyes converge, the point at which they converge appears perfectly 
    clear. The fact is that everything else appears blurry but you don't notice 
    it because you are used to it. However, due to the accomodation reflex, when 
    you look at something blurry your eyes will naturely adjust to it. In a 
    stereo image, all the image has to be clear to be viewed clearly at whatever 
    point you look in the image. Converging on one point would make the image 
    comfortable for all points before the converging point. However, this would 
    be difficult for points after it to fuse. By converging at the infinity, 
    i.e., keeping viewing axes parallel, all the image will be easy to fuse. 
    <P>Things become a little more complex when you want to see in stereo a 
    stereo pair . . . To fuse the two images you've produced in a stereo one, 
    each eye must see only its own image. Different solutions have been found 
    over the years, mainly a result of the use of stereo pairs from stereo 
    cameras used during the 50's and 60's. You can use a lens stereoscope but 
    you will have to transform your two images onto slides. You can also use a 
    mirror stereoscope (If you can find one . . .) but you will have to print 
    your images. 
    <P>It's possible to directly use the screen but that will divide the usuable 
    surface on the screen into two; as you will have to display the two images 
    side by side. If you do not have stereoscope, you could train to "free- 
    view" by crossing your eyes with the right view on the left and the left 
    view on the right as many stereo enthusiasts do. You will need time and 
    patience as it is not totally obvious . . . 
    <P>The best known solution is to write your own "SoftStereo" code. Then, use 
    LCD shutter glasses. 
    <P>The trouble is that this solution is not adapted for your aim if you just 
    want to make some stereo images yourself. You can do this out of curiosity 
    to see what it looks like by using your own computer and software you are 
    accustomed to. 
    <P>To do so in a cheap and quick way is absolutely possible, but, (Of course 
    there is a but) there will be some restrictions about the kind of images you 
    will be able to convert properly into stereo. However, that will give you 
    the opportunity to verify by yourself the interest to escape "flatland". 
    <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name=Warhol></A><B>2.) Andy Warhol, creature of the black lagoon and 
    comics</B> 
    <P>They have all used a stereo process. Andy Warhol produced a 3D movie 
    "Frankenstein" in the 1970's. Creature of the black lagoon is one of the 
    most popular 3D anaglyph movies. From time to time, comics use that process 
    too. (Notice that, in that last case, each stereo pair is hand made ...) 
    Unfortunately, most of those realizations suffer from terrible defects. They 
    often have as a result an audience that is disgusted from stereo. The fact 
    is that the anaglyph process by itself is not a bad one but is difficult to 
    apply with optical systems. Let's analyze those old results and have a close 
    look to the "theory". Let's see how to apply it correctly with a computer. 
    <P>In comics, left and right images are printed, one with blue ink and the 
    other with red ink. Looking with red-blue anaglyph glasses, you can see 
    monsters springing from the page. In movies, red and blue filters are added 
    to the cameras as well as the audience wearing their own red-blue glasses. 
    Red and blue are used as they are opposite colors: you cannot see through a 
    red filter what you can see through a blue one, and the reverse is true. The 
    stereo separation is correct for each eye but the stereo image is black and 
    white. 
    <P>If you're aware about computer image formats, when reading "red-blue" 
    you've probably the temptation to insert "green" to read "red-green-blue". 
    Congratulations, you've found the first step to the solution. <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name=colorscreen></A><B>3.) All color screens are stereo ready</B> 
    <P>Computer's images are displayed on color screens and those screens use 
    the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) system to create the color of each pixel of the 
    image. That means all computer's images are made with three bands: a red 
    one, a green one and a blue one. Suppose now we have tools to take only one 
    color band from an image. If we take the red band from the left image and 
    the blue band from the right image, we will just need a tool to glue those 
    two bands together and we will have a computer anaglyph giving black and 
    white stereo when wearing red-left and blue-right glasses. 
    <P>Numerous software to manipulate images and to translate them between the 
    different formats can be used to process the color bands and produce 3D.(See 
    paragraph "Suggestions about appropriate hardware and software") You just 
    need tools which allows the separation of bands and which allows black and 
    white bands to be glued back as color bands; thus producing a color image. 
    <P>If you rush immediately to convert your own stereo pairs into red-blue 
    anaglyphs by playing with the RGB bands you will probably be deceived. 
    First, you will only have magenta and white stereo images, not really black 
    and white ones (Red + blue = magenta). Secondly, stereo images are 
    definitively not flat images and special manipulations have to be applied to 
    them for correct viewing. <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name=green></A><B>4.) Playing on the green</B> 
    <P>Magenta and white stereo is not interesting, black and white should be 
    better, but color should be much more interesting. So, how can we produce 
    color stereo images on the screen? Flat color images are made with three 
    bands. This means that the three bands will probably also have to be used 
    for color stereo. From which image must we take the green band? Red and 
    green filters are opposite and turn to dark if added. In contrast, blue and 
    green filters are not opposite and turn to cyan if added. The green 
    information must come from the same filter as the blue. This means that the 
    blue and green band will both have to come from the same image: the right 
    one. 
    <P>(Why use the red filter on the left and the cyan on the right? It could 
    be the reverse but the International Stereoscopic Union has chosen the red 
    on left for standard disposal. It is also in coordination with the red used 
    in international marking such as: ships, planes, and politicians!) 
    <P>Now, if you convert a stereo pair into a color anaglyph by separating the 
    bands and after, glue them , you will be able to see in stereo and in color 
    directly on your monitor by just using red-cyan anaglyph glasses. Easy! 
    <P>If you do not have anaglyph glasses with a cyan filter, you can use ones 
    with a blue or a green filter: stereo 3D effect will remain but colors will 
    change. With a blue filter, colors will slightly shift to blue. Avoid green 
    anaglyph glasses as it wipes really too much colors. (See paragraph 
    "Anaglyph glasses") <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name=colortricks></A><B>5.) Color tricks</B> 
    <P>Things are a bit more complex than they should be relating to the 
    previous explanations. 
    <P>The fact is that not all images can be converted. Images with strong 
    contrast zones are definitively not adapted. They produce what stereo 
    addicts call "ghosts". Strong contrast zones produce anaglyphs with too 
    close and too strong red and cyan spots. This produce a very uncomfortable 
    sensation through the red-cyan glasses. Images with large zones of saturated 
    colors will produce "ghosts" too. All the left information comes from one 
    color, red. If your image has large red zones, there will be no information 
    (No green nor blue) for the right eye about those zones. No stereo effect 
    will appear there. The same trouble happens with green and blue zones. There 
    is nothing to do for images with strong contrast (excepted creating the same 
    image without the strong contrast . . . For example, you can change a black 
    background into a grey background or you can try to change the lighting), 
    even though it is still possible to use images with saturated colors. If 
    those saturated zones were gray there should be no problems as all the three 
    bands should be the same on the zones. 
    <P>Thus, We have to find a solution that will shift colors to grays but, yet 
    respect the balance of space information between the two eyes. This solution 
    should also respect the original colors (if possible) and the three bands. 
    The solution will be to modify the saturation of the images. Modifying 
    saturation will allow us to modify the quantity of colors in an image by 
    keeping for the resulting image only a few percentages of colors from the 
    original image. Notice that fully decreasing saturation turns the image into 
    some kind of black and white version still coded on RGB. The correct way to 
    produce really black &amp; white images is to use a dedicated tool. (We will 
    see later where is the difference.) A tool converting into Black and White 
    will allow us directly to produce black &amp; white stereo images. 
    <P>Saturation 0 is the ultimate weapon against saturated spots. The trouble 
    is it wipes all colors. It would be better if it were possible to modify the 
    colors wiping only the spots that produce "ghosts". A way to do this is to 
    use an image processing software to change the hue or to reduce the 
    saturation of the spots before producing the anaglyph. The fact is that 
    using an image processing software, fighting the ghosts can be long. This 
    does not suit our original aim to produce stereo images in a quick way. We 
    will so use another concept, the Chopin &amp; Lanfranchi method, based on 
    the fact that main problems with ghosts come from red and green. 
    <P>In blue zones, ghosting is very light and is often ignored by viewers, so 
    we can keep without any change the blue band from the right image. Red and 
    green bands have to be modified to decrease the difference between red and 
    green contributions on each pixel. On a black and white image, there is no 
    difference between these two bands; they are exactly the same. That's why 
    there are no ghosting problems with black and white stereo 3D. We will so 
    take red and green bands from the black and white versions of the left and 
    right images. 
    <P>There are two other simple ways to modify red and green bands to wipe 
    ghosting colors. Software which convert to black &amp; white make some kind 
    of average calculation between the three bands to produce a single black and 
    white band. The formula used to get one value from three is: black &amp; 
    white = 0.30 red + 0.59 green + 0.11 blue. 0.30, 0.59 and 0.11 are values 
    related to the sensitivity of the human eye. We can make similar 
    calculations to obtain other average values. We will produce images shifting 
    to yellow if we use the following formula: new value = 0.50 red + 0.50 green 
    = average (red + green) We will produce images shifting to gray if we use 
    the following formula: new value = 1/3 red + 1/3 green + 1/3 blue = average 
    (red + green + blue) 
    <P>The result of such manipulations is to shift the colors to shades of dark 
    green and brown, yellow, or gray. It is not very aesthetic but it suits 
    perfectly well with red-cyan glasses. . . 
    <P>All those tricks should allow you to find quickly a comfortable 
    anaglyphic version from most of your stereo pairs. <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name=window></A><B>6.) Stereo advanced rules: windows</B> 
    <P>In anaglyphs, and more generally in all stereo images, we find that they 
    are not images but volumes. Specific rules, which are not in use with flat 
    images, have to be respected to display the volumes. 
    <P>Unless you are standing alone with nothing more than the horizon and the 
    sky around you, space appears relative to some frontiers. This is what 
    happens when you look through a window. In the case of a stereo image 
    displayed on a computer screen, the four physical sides of the screen (Left, 
    right, up and down) are absolute frontiers. They build a window through 
    which you can see the stereo reconstructed space. That introduces the 
    following specific restriction: If any side of the images of a stereo pair 
    cuts any part of the scene, this part must stand just beside the screen 
    sides on the stereo image. That means that you cannot see in front of a 
    window something that is too large to go through this window. The spatial 
    coherency has to be respected between the stereo scene and the screen that 
    displays it. 
    <P>Very often you will have to move your stereo image back into the screen . 
    If you don't do it, you will produce stereo images that viewers will not be 
    able to fuse. A typical reason is that points that normally should be at the 
    infinity (Or at least far away) will lie just on the screen surface. They 
    will have quite no parallax. This will make an aberrant springing stereo 
    image, completely out from the screen.

    <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name=backward-forward></A><B>7.) Backward and forward</B> 
    <P>On the anaglyph, two pixels that reconstruct one stereo 3D point have an 
    horizontal offset (Parallax). The position of a stereo-reconstructed point 
    depends on the distance between its left and right pixels. Stereo points 
    lying on the physical screen surface have no offset. 
    <P>Moving the stereo image relatively to the screen will simply result in 
    changing the distances between the left and right pixels. If you do so on an 
    anaglyph you will notice some rather blurry stripes when looking at the 
    sides with the red-cyan glasses. This is because the stereoscopic window is 
    not set. With stereo paper prints, the window is set by cutting those 
    stripes. 
    <P><IMG height=360 alt="With Stereoscopic Window" 
    src="How to make 3D-pictures by computer_arquivos/drawing2.gif" width=359> 
    <P>If a stripe is cut from the left of the left image and another stripe is 
    cut from the right of the right image, the entire stereo image moves 
    backward. If a stripe is cut from the right of the left image and another 
    stripe is cut from the left of the right image, the entire stereo image 
    moves forward. A version of that operation is for a computer anaglyph to 
    roll the red band. After, it can cut the ghosting stripes appearing on the 
    sides. Notice that, as a consequence, the moved stereo image will be 
    represented by an anaglyph which will have a width less than the width of 
    the original images of the stereo pair. <BR>&nbsp; 
    <P><A name=Conclusion></A><B>Conclusion</B> 
    <P>The drawing below summarizes the whole computer anaglyph process. Despite 
    it suffering from tremendous restrictions, anaglyphs stays the easiest way 
    to experience color stereoscopy on a computer.

    <P>Have a try: you'll be surprised to see how a stereo 3D scene is different 
    from what you thought while just looking at it from 3D images. <BR>&nbsp;
